## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### Things I'm currently working on :wrench:

##### Other things I have done in the past:

- [Android transposition application](https://github.com/enteraname74/Transposer) (made with Kotlin + XML)

### What I'm currently learning :mortar_board:

I'm a big fan of Kotlin, so I love to work with Kotlin related technologies like:
- KMP
- Jetpack Compose
- Kotlin/JS, KVision
- Ktor

I also like to build things with other technologies, such as:
- Flutter
- Rust
- GTK4
